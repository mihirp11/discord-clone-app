## Coding Decisions
- Socket Io is used to provide live updates to users, an important consideration was socket errors when using the app router in newer versions of nextjs api. Due to this the pages api router is used specifically for all socket api calls. The fallback is using polling every second when the socket is not connected to get recent messages and to send them.
  
- Tailwind css is used due to it not needing redundant css files and inline styles when differentiating between styles with dark and light mode. Tailwind also allows for hover effects in many buttons and portions of the app without needing to create new eventhandlers for each separate effect/location. Conditional styling using tailwind and cn function also removes need for multiple portions in a css file. Responsive design is built into tailwind's modifiers.

- Clerk allows for simple and quick user authentication. It is an easy solution to make sure users are able to sign in through many apps, without needing to create separate keys and secrets for each individual OAuth credential. Redirecting users to a sign in is also simple if a non user tries to visit a restricted page.

- uploadthing has file hosting and is built to be compatible with Nextjs and Typescript. Rapid upload and link creation allows easy file and image sharing in both messages as well as the images for channels and servers. Built in UI is easily modifiable to fit application needs.

-LiveKit provides a way to create audio and video calls between either two users or with a whole channel. LiveKits components are pre-styled and can be included in the app quickly
